# Liver_and_tumors_segmentation

This is a student-level research paper at Saigon University. 

Project title: ***Apply intelligent calculations to segmentaiton liver and liver tumor on MRI 3D.*** 

The goal of this research is to propose a model using algorithms to segmentation the liver and liver tumors on MR images.

The research team proposed a model using **FCN algorithm** in deep learning with **Unet 2D architecture** to solve this problem.

## Data

The data set we used to research is mentioned by [Hieu Trung Huynh](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-016-1498-9) (because of data security, we will not public data here).

## Getting Started

To serve the results of this study, we used ggColab to run models of liver and liver tumor segmentation. 

## Our solutions and code
All data processing and model building information is described in the summary file [liver_segmentation](https://github.com/hieukut456/Liver_and_tumors_segmentation/blob/master/liver_segmentation.docx) (Vietnamese language)

All our code will be show here:
